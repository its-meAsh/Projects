# Projects ðŸš€


This repository serves as the consolidated collection of my personal Python projects, showcasing work across computational simulation, procedural generation, and custom media visualization. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates proficiency in translating complex mathematical and physical concepts into dynamic code.

## Repository Focus

The projects within this repository are primarily focused on the following areas:

* **Computational Simulation:** Building custom engines to model real-world phenomena, such as gravitational physics and fluid dynamics.
* **Procedural Generation:** Creating complex structures (like mazes or cellular patterns) from simple rules and initial conditions.
* **Low-Level Media Processing:** Utilizing libraries like Pillow and OpenCV to manipulate pixel arrays, generate dynamic video output, and transform data into various media formats (audio, video, custom files).
* **Numerical Methods:** Applying efficient data structures and array processing (NumPy) to solve challenging mathematical problems.
